<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a Primary School Teacher learning web development. It has been a tough journey but I am learning to 
  enjoy the ride and trust the process.</p>

<p>So far, I have created two web pages. The first one is my movie ranking project, linked on the homepage. The second 
  one is my birthday invite, also linked on the homepage.</p>

<p>Check out my web pages and keep an eye out for any new ones.</p>
